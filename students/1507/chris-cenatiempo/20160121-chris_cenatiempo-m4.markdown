# Chris Cenatiempo - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Prior to the module my goal was to dive deeper into Javascript and client side development. In addition to my goal of attaining more technical knowledge, I was also set on attaining employment with a company that would be willing to mentor. Throughout this module, I've learned to enjoy front-end frame works and enjoy how easy it is to set up Rails. For the future I plan to continue to learn and keep in touch with fellow Turing students.

### Feedback Given to Me

Sadly I never got to pair with Chris on a project. I didn’t realize this until late in the program. I was in a deep dark hell hole of JavaScript and Chris helped me out of it. He didn’t have to, but spent 2+ hours with me, helping me debug an issue I had for the previous 28 hours. He is selfless and awesome. I will miss working with him.

One area for improvement would be to not get so frustrated on setting up Rails/Express etc. I would recommend working with people who enjoy Dev Ops!

### Playing a Part In the Community

* On Tuesday, Oct 13, I attended Denver.rb meetup to hear Marla's lighting talk about Ruby Tooling
* On Friday, Oct 26, I gave a student led session on Matlab (https://gist.github.com/ChrisCenatie/85e24bdfab2051ae133a)
* On Wednesday, Nov 18, I attended the DeRailed Developer meetup (http://www.meetup.com/DeRailed/)


## Goals Moving Forward

I plan on taking what I've learned and applying it throughout my career. I'm really grateful for being able to take part at Turing! This has really been one of the best experiences of my life!
